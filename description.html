<p>
This demo is using the Platform API for Isilon (sometimes referred to as PAPI).<br>
The Platform API allows you to query and even send commands to an Isilon cluster. 
The commands are sent in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> fashion.<br>  
This essentially means that the information is being accessed as if the application were accessing a web page from a webserver (the Isilon cluster being that webserver).<br>
</p>
<p>
To access we do need to provide a username and password (so that it is secure) although note that in this demo application the username and password given are not well protected (it is a simple test).
</p>
<p>
The information sent back is in a format called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON'>JSON</a> which is a method for encoding an array, which can be decoded 
and then used in a program (in this case PHP).
</p>
<p>
The demo uses PHP and JQUERY (PHP doing the work, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery">JQUERY</a> making it act in a nice interactive manner).
</p>
<p>
Although you can see all of the <a href="./source_code.php">Source code</a> to highlight <b>the two most important lines</b> from the PHP code:
</p>
<p>
<code>$encodedcontents = @file_get_contents($service_url,false,$context);</code><br><br>
The <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php">file_get_contents</a> function downloads the 'web content' from the array using the url given.  To see the urls see the examples under the 'view detail' links, these are formed into the $service_url variable.
Note the $context variable is just to setup the web authentication as PAPI uses the secure web protocol HTTPS rather than simple HTTP.
</p><p>
<code>$decodedcontents = @json_decode($encodedcontents,true);</code><br><br>

The <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php">json_decode</a> function takes the raw JSON encoded text that we downloaded in the last command and 
re-encodes it from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON'>JSON</a> text to a useable, native <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php">array</a> (or group of variables) so that we can do something with it in PHP.
</p>
Although this is a simple '101' demo, to see how PAPI can be used to help create powerful applications for use with Isilon clusters see:
